VOLTTRON™ is versatile. Designed initially to improve power grid operations, this technology enables decision-making and solutions for any need that requires collection, management and analysis of data streams. Just use your imagination!

VOLTTRON™ is:

* Secure
* Functional, supporting energy, operational and financial transactions between network entities
* Scalable
* Interoperable
* Sophisticated yet simple—providing a readily useful environment for quick, cost-effective solution development.
 Beyond grid and buildings, potential uses extend to improved interoperability between utility systems and proprietary home energy technologies; cybersecurity applications; data management; product tracking; energy efficiency in non-building disciplines, such as irrigation management; and more.

The VOLTTRON™ platform—and by extension, its users—continues to benefit from the U.S. Department of Energy’s ongoing development funding and support. DOE wants to optimize the platform for buildings-grid integration and transactive energy, but the agency also is supportive of alternate uses—and full realization—of the technology’s potential.
