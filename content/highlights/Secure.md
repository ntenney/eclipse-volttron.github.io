From the beginning, VOLTTRON™ developers actively collaborated with cyber security experts and built security into the technology, rather than “bolting it on” later. The commitment has continued, with developers regularly upgrading features in response to emerging requirements and VOLTTRON™ user feedback.

The platform applies a threat-model approach for determining software threats and vulnerabilities and how to reasonably reduce the attack surface and/or harm from a compromise. Through established mitigation strategies, VOLTTRON™ addresses a range of possible attack avenues and risks.
