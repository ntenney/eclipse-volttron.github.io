The VOLTTRON™ software is open source and available to users at no cost. It was designed for small computing devices, such as Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone Black, and the platform itself uses minimal resources. This greatly reduces hardware costs for its deployment.

Users have found that other characteristics—such as VOLTTRON™’s security, interoperability between different devices, portability and flexibility, and easy application development—underscore the software’s cost-effectiveness and versatility. Reduced implementation costs and cycle time lead to productive solution development.
