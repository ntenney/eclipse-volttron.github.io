VOLTTRON™ was created as an overarching integration platform to bring together vendors, users and developers, enable rapid application development and testing, and support modern control strategies.

The platform is a cost and time saver. It is flexible, not linking applications to a specific language; interoperable across vendors and applications; and facilitates easy application development and scale-up.

These characteristics allow developers to work with devices, external resources, and each other over a common interface without worrying about underlying details, which enhances application development.
