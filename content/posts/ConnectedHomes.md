 Connecting the power system and utilities with the functions that improve home livability, VOLTTRON™ plays a key role in helping to manage wiser, more efficient use of energy resources.  
 
 **Bringing home the savings!** Connected home devices—such as smart appliances and security systems—are projected to grow their market share significantly to reach $490 billion in 2019. However, many smart technologies lack connections to their community and the power grid.

Truly connected smart homes should not only benefit their occupants, they should also benefit the community as a whole by helping strengthen the grid and by building a more resilient and reliable utility network. VOLTTRON™ makes this possible.
